		stream

stream is a communication path bet'n source and destination.

There are two types of streams
a) input stream :- for reading
b) output stream :- for writing

if u want to read, u need to open input stream on the source ( e.g. file, array, network )

if u want to write ,u need to open output stream on destination ( e.g. file, array, network )

Java has two categories of streams

Byte streams and Unicode character streams

Byte Streams

Purpose: Byte streams are used for handling raw binary data like images, audio files, videos, and other non-text data. They read and write data byte by byte.

Classes:

InputStream (for reading) → e.g., FileInputStream
OutputStream (for writing) → e.g., FileOutputStream


Unicode (Character) Streams

Purpose: Unicode streams (character streams) are used for handling text data, ensuring proper encoding and decoding (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16). They read and write data character by character, making them suitable for processing text files.

Classes:

Reader (for reading) → e.g., FileReader
Writer (for writing) → e.g., FileWriter

File class in Java:
	File class in java is used to get information about file or folder such as whether file exists or not, its length, date of last modification etc.

Entire io support is available from "java.io" package.
