

	Java8 interface changes

	1) default methods ( virtual methods ) with definition

		e.g

	interface First
	{
		void disp1();  // public and abstract
		
		default void disp2()
		{
			some code
		}
	}

it means implementation class of "First" has to define "disp1"
and "disp2" will be simply inherited inside the child class or at the most child class can override it.




	2) static methods
