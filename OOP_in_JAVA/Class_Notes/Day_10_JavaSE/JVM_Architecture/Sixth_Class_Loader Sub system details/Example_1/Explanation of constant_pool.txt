inside constant pool


#1 = Methodref          #6.#15         // java/lang/Object."<init>":()V

	
		inside public Sample();

					invokespecial #1


#1 is a symbol for java/lang/Object."<init>":()V i.e. Object class default constructor as you know the first line of Sample class constructor is always a call to Object class default constructor.


inside 
	 public static void main(java.lang.String[]);

					getstatic     #2

and in the constant pool

			#2 = Fieldref      // java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;

so here "getstatic   #2" means to access static member "System.out"


ldc        #3      

		in the constant pool #3

			#3 = String             // Hello World

so "ldc" instruction tells JVM to extract "Hello world" from constant pool and place it on the operand stack [ the operand stack is part of the stack frame for each method invocation ] so that it will be utilize to call "println()" method. 

				invokevirtual #4
in the constant pool,
		#4 = Methodref             // java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V

it means "invokevirtual  #4" tells JVM to invoke or call "println" method
