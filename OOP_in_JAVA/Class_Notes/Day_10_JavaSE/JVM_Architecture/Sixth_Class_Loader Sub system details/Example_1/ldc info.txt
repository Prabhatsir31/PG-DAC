In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the ldc instruction stands for "Load Constant." It is used to load a constant value from the constant pool of the class into the operand stack. This constant value can be an integer, float, string, or reference to a class or method, depending on the specific constant being referenced. The ldc instruction is often used to push literal values onto the stack for use in computations or method calls.
