list.stream().filter(i -> i > 10).mapToInt(i -> i).sum();

stream() and  filter() methods return "Stream"
mapToInt() returns "IntStream". Hence they are intermediate operations.

sum() method of IntStream returns "int". Hence it is a terminal operation.

only after terminal operation is encountered , pipeline starts executing tasks one by one.
