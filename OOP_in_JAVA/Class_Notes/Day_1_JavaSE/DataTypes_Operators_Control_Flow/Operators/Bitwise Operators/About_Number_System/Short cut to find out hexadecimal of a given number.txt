suppose we want to find out hexadecimal of 35

1) method is:

				Hexadecimal of 35


	16	35	
	16	2	3
	16	0	2


	0 	2	3

	16[2]	16[1]	16[0]

	  	32    +	3

so hexadecimal of 35 is     023


2) method is:

go on writing

	
	16[1]	16[0]  .. till you get power of 16 greater than the given number
		i.e. 35

so here  16[0]  is 1
	 16[1]  is 16

   16[2] is 256 which is larger than 35

so we should take only  16[1] and 16[0]

now think how many times we need to take 16[1] so that the result won't be more than 35 ?
	it's 16[1]  2 times
		and that comes to 16*2  i.e.  32

			35-32  is 3

now think how many times we need to take 16[0] so that the result will be 3?
	it's 16[0]  3 times
		and that comes to 16[0] * 3  which comes to 3

so if we consider the order
	16[1]        16[0]

	2	     3

so hexadecimal of 35 is       23
