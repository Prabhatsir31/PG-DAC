suppose we want to find out octal of 35

1) method is:

			Octal of 35
	
	8	35	
	8	4	3
	8	0	4


	0	4	3

	8[2]	8[1]	8[0]

	    32  +	3

2) method is:

go on writing

	
	8[1]	8[0]  .. till you get power of 8 greater than the given number
		i.e. 35

so here  8[0]  is 1
	 8[1]  is 8

but   8[2] is 64 which is larger than 35

so we should take only  8[1] and 8[0]

now think how many times we need to take 8[1] so that the result won't be more than 35 ?
	it's 8[1]  4 times
		and that comes to 8*4  i.e.  32

			35-32  is 3

now think how many times we need to take 8[0] so that the result will be 3?
	it's 8[0]  3 times
		and that comes to 8[0] * 3  which comes to 3

so if we consider the order
	8[1]        8[0]

	4	     3

so octal of 35 is       43
